## Serhii Smetanskyi

**Automation Engineer • AI Agent Builder • Workflow Designer**

I'm an Automation Engineer with a strong background in Quality Assurance and Software Development. I specialize in creating AI agents and Automated Workflows that eliminate routine tasks, optimize processes, and reduce time and resource waste.

With hands-on experience in Software Development, I design automations that are not only efficient — but also robust, scalable, and easy to maintain.

I build automations that run 24/7, reliably and autonomously — no manual input required.

I keep it simple — using only the tools that fit your goals and make things easier.
